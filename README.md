# React Native simple application, Lab 41 (Phase 1)

this application is a trial of using React Native to build a simple app with one mobile native feature such as the camera. 

Expo snack is used instead of local IDE and Emulators to build the application.

This is the link to the code and all you have to do is to scan the bar code after selecting "Your device" on the right side of the website to test the application on your device.
